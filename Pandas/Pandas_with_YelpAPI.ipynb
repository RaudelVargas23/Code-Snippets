Write two functions, `extract_hour` and `extract_mins` that converts military time to hours and minutes, respectively. Hint: You may want to use modular arithmetic and integer division. Keep in mind that the data has not been cleaned and you need to check whether the extracted values are valid. Replace all the invalid values with `NaN`. The documentation for `pandas.Series.where` provided [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.where.html) should be helpful."

    "There are various authentication schemes that APIs use, listed here in relative order of complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "* No authentication\n",
    "* [HTTP basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)\n",
    "* Cookie based user login\n",
    "* OAuth (v1.0 & v2.0, see this [post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4113934/how-is-oauth-2-different-from-oauth-1) explaining the differences)\n",
    "* API keys\n",
    "* Custom Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "For the NYT example below (**Q2.1**), since it is a publicly visible page we did not need to authenticate. HTTP basic authentication isn't too common for consumer sites/applications that have the concept of user accounts (like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.) but is simple to setup quickly and you often encounter it on with individual password protected pages/sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cookie based user login is what the majority of services use when you login with a browser (i.e. username and password). Once you sign in to a service like Facebook, the response stores a cookie in your browser to remember that you have logged in (HTTP is stateless). Each subsequent request to the same domain (i.e. any page on `facebook.com`) also sends the cookie that contains the authentication information to remind Facebook's servers that you have already logged in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many REST APIs however use OAuth (authentication using tokens) which can be thought of a programmatic way to \"login\" _another_ user. Using tokens, a user (or application) only needs to send the login credentials once in the initial authentication and as a response from the server gets a special signed token. This signed token is then sent in future requests to the server (in place of the user credentials).\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar concept common used by many APIs is to assign API Keys to each client that needs access to server resources. The client must then pass the API Key along with _every_ request it makes to the API to authenticate. This is because the server is typically relatively stateless and does not maintain a session between subsequent calls from the same client. Most APIs (including Yelp) allow you to pass the API Key via a special HTTP Header: `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>`. Check out the [docs](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/authentication) for more information."

programmer or AI specialist, you surely can put huge number of news articles to some good use. Getting those articles can be challenging though as you will have to go through quite a few hoops to get to the actual data - finding the right news sources, exploring their APIs, figuring out how to authenticate against them and finally scraping the data. That&#39;s a lot of work and no fun. </p><p> So, to save you some time and get you started, here&#39;s list of public news APIs that I was able to find, with explanation how authenticate against them, query them and most importantly examples for how to get all the data you need from them! </p><h2>NY Times</h2><p> First and the best source of data is in my opinion <i>New Your Times</i>. To start using its API you need to create an account at <a href=\"https://developer.nytimes.com/accounts/create\">https://developer.nytimes.com/accounts/create</a> and an application at <a href=\"https://developer.nytimes.com/my-apps/new-app\">https://developer.nytimes.com/my-apps/new-app</a>. When creating the application you get to choose which APIs to activate - I recommend activating at least <i>Most Popular</i>, <i>Article Search</i>, <i>Top Stories</i> and <i>Archive APIs</i>. When your application is created you will be presented with the key which you will use to interact all the selected APIs, so copy it and let&#39;s start querying! </p><p> The simplest query we can do with <i>NY Times</i> API is look up for current top stories: </p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">\\nimport requests\\nimport os\\nfrom pprint import pprint\\n\\napikey = os.getenv(&#39;NYTIMES_APIKEY&#39;, &#39;...&#39;)\\n\\n# Top Stories:\\n# https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/top-stories-product/1/overview\\nsection = &quot;science&quot;\\nquery_url = f&quot;https://api.nytimes.com/svc/topstories/v2/{section}.json?api-key={apikey}&quot;\\n\\nr = requests.get(query_url)\\npprint(r.json())\\n</code></pre><p> The snippet above is very straightforward. We run a <code class=\"inline\">GET</code> request against <code class=\"inline\">topstories/v2</code> endpoint supplying <code class=\"inline\">section</code> name and our API key. Section in this case is <i>science</i>, but <i>NY Times</i> provides a lot of other options here, e.g. fashion, health, sports or theater. Full list can be found <a href=\"https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/top-stories-product/1/overview\">here</a>. This specific request would produce response that would look something like this: </p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">\\n{ &#39;last_updated&#39;: &#39;2020-08-09T08:07:44-04:00&#39;,\\n &#39;num_results&#39;: 25,\\n &#39;results&#39;: [{&#39;abstract&#39;: &#39;New Zealand marked 100 days with no new reported &#39;\\n                          &#39;cases of local coronavirus transmission.

The only mandatory field is <code class=\"inline\">q</code> (query), which is the search term. Beyond that you can mix and match filter query, date range (<code class=\"inline\">begin_date</code>, <code class=\"inline\">end_date</code>), page number, sort order and facet fields. The filter query (<code class=\"inline\">fq</code>) is interesting one, as it allows use of <i>Lucene query syntax</i>, which can be used to create complex filters with logical operators (<code class=\"inline\">AND</code>, <code class=\"inline\">OR</code>), negations or wildcards. Nice tutorial can be found <a href=\"http://www.lucenetutorial.com/lucene-query-syntax.html\">here</a>. </p><p> Example response for above query might like this (some fields were removed for clarity): </p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">\\n{&#39;response&#39;: {&#39;docs&#39;: [{&#39;_id&#39;: &#39;nyt://article/0bf06be1-6699-527f-acb0-09fdd8abb6f6&#39;,\\n                        &#39;abstract&#39;: &#39;The president sidestepped Congress when it became clear that his nominee for a &#39;\\n                                    &#39;top Defense Department position would not win Senate approval.&#39;,\\n                        &#39;byline&#39;: {&#39;original&#39;: &#39;By Helene Cooper&#39;},\\n                        &#39;document_type&#39;: &#39;article&#39;,\\n                        &#39;headline&#39;: {&#39;main&#39;: &#39;Trump Puts Pentagon in Political Crossfire With Tata Appointment&#39;,\\n                                     &#39;print_headline&#39;: &#39;Bypassing Congress to Appoint Ally, Trump Puts Pentagon in Political Crossfire&#39;},\\n                        &#39;keywords&#39;: [{&#39;major&#39;: &#39;N&#39;, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;subject&#39;, &#39;rank&#39;: 1,\\n                                      &#39;value&#39;: &#39;United States Politics and Government&#39;},\\n                                     {&#39;major&#39;: &#39;N&#39;, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;subject&#39;, &#39;rank&#39;: 2,\\n                                      &#39;value&#39;: &#39;Appointments and Executive Changes&#39;},\\n                                     {&#39;major&#39;: &#39;N&#39;, &#39;name&#39;: &#39;subject&#39;, &#39;rank&#39;: 3,\\n                                      &#39;value&#39;: &#39;Presidential Election of 2020&#39;}],\\n                        &#39;lead_paragraph&#39;: &#39;WASHINGTON — In making an end run around Congress to appoint Anthony J.

Beside these, there are bunch more available at <a href=\"https://developer.nytimes.com/apis\">https://developer.nytimes.com/apis</a>. To explore each API, I would also recommend playing with query builder like <a href=\"https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/articlesearch-product/1/routes/articlesearch.json/get\">the one for article search</a>, which lets you and build and execute your test query right on the website without any coding. </p><h2>The Guardian</h2><p> Next up is another great source of news and articles - <i>The Guardian</i>. Same as with <i>NY Times</i>, we first need to sign up for an API key. You can do so at <a href=\"https://bonobo.capi.gutools.co.uk/register/developer\">https://bonobo.capi.gutools.co.uk/register/developer</a> and you will receive your key in an email. With that out of the way, we can navigate to <a href=\"https://open-platform.theguardian.com/documentation/\">API documentation</a> and start querying the API. </p><p> Let&#39;s start simply by querying content sections of <i>The Guardian</i>: </p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">\\n# https://open-platform.theguardian.com/documentation/section\\nquery = &quot;science&quot;\\nquery_url = f&quot;https://content.guardianapis.com/sections?&quot; \\\\\\n            f&quot;api-key={apikey}&quot; \\\\\\n\\nr = requests.get(query_url)\\npprint(r.json())\\n\\n{&#39;response&#39;: {&#39;results&#39;: [{&#39;apiUrl&#39;: &#39;https://content.guardianapis.com/science&#39;,\\n                           &#39;editions&#39;: [{&#39;apiUrl&#39;: &#39;https://content.guardianapis.com/science&#39;,\\n                                         &#39;code&#39;: &#39;default&#39;,\\n                                         &#39;id&#39;: &#39;science&#39;,\\n                                         &#39;webTitle&#39;: &#39;Science&#39;,\\n                                         &#39;webUrl&#39;: &#39;https://www.theguardian.com/science&#39;}],\\n                           &#39;id&#39;: &#39;science&#39;,\\n                           &#39;webTitle&#39;: &#39;Science&#39;,\\n                           &#39;webUrl&#39;: &#39;https://www.theguardian.com/science&#39;}],\\n              &#39;status&#39;: &#39;ok&#39;,\\n              &#39;total&#39;: 1,\\n              &#39;userTier&#39;: &#39;developer&#39;}}\\n</code></pre><p> These sections group content into topics, which can be useful if you are looking for specific type of content, e.g. <i>science</i> or <i>technology</i>. If we omit the query (<code class=\"inline\">q</code>) parameter, we will instead receive full list of sections, which is about 75 records. </p><p> Moving on to something little more interesting - searching by <i>tags</i>: </p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">\\n# https://open-platform.theguardian.com/documentation/tag\\nquery = &quot;weather&quot;\\nsection = &quot;news&quot;\\npage = &quot;1&quot;\\nquery_url = f&quot;http://content.guardianapis.com/tags?&quot; \\\\\\n            f&quot;api-key={apikey}&quot; \\\\\\n            f&quot;&amp;q={query}&quot; \\\\\\n            f&quot;&amp;page={page}&quot;\\n\\nr = requests.get(query_url)\\npprint(r.json())\\n\\n{&#39;response&#39;: {&#39;currentPage&#39;: 1,\\n              &#39;pageSize&#39;: 10,\\n              &#39;pages&#39;: 139,\\n              &#39;results&#39;: [\\n                          {&#39;apiUrl&#39;: &#39;https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/australia-weather&#39;,\\n                           &#39;id&#39;: &#39;australia-news/australia-weather&#39;,\\n                           &#39;sectionId&#39;: &#39;australia-news&#39;,\\n                           &#39;sectionName&#39;: &#39;Australia news&#39;,\\n                           &#39;type&#39;: &#39;keyword&#39;,\\n                           &#39;webTitle&#39;: &#39;Australia weather&#39;,\\n                           &#39;webUrl&#39;: &#39;https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australia-weather&#39;},\\n                          {&#39;apiUrl&#39;: &#39;https://content.guardianapis.com/world/extreme-weather&#39;,\\n                           &#39;id&#39;: &#39;world/extreme-weather&#39;,\\n                           &#39;sectionId&#39;: &#39;world&#39;,\\n                           &#39;sectionName&#39;: &#39;World news&#39;,\\n                           &#39;type&#39;: &#39;keyword&#39;,\\n                           &#39;webTitle&#39;: &#39;Extreme weather&#39;,\\n                           &#39;webUrl&#39;: &#39;https://www.theguardian.com/world/extreme-weather&#39;},\\n                          ],\\n              &#39;startIndex&#39;: 1,\\n              &#39;status&#39;: &#39;ok&#39;,\\n              &#39;total&#39;: 1385,\\n              &#39;userTier&#39;: &#39;developer&#39;}}\\n</code></pre><p> This query looks quite similar to the previous one and also returns similar kinds of data. Tags also group content into categories, but there are a lot more tags (around 50000) than sections. Each of these tags have structure like for example <code class=\"inline\">world/extreme-weather</code>. These are very useful when doing search for actual articles, which is what we will do next. </p><p> The one thing you really came here for is article search and for that we will use <a href=\"https://open-platform.theguardian.com/documentation/search\">https://open-platform.theguardian.com/documentation/search</a>: </p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">\\nquery = &quot;(hurricane OR storm)&quot;\\nquery_fields = &quot;body&quot;\\nsection = &quot;news&quot;  # https://open-platform.theguardian.com/documentation/section\\ntag = &quot;world/extreme-weather&quot;  # https://open-platform.theguardian.com/documentation/tag\\nfrom_date = &quot;2019-01-01&quot;\\nquery_url = f&quot;https://content.guardianapis.com/search?&quot; \\\\\\n            f&quot;api-key={apikey}&quot; \\\\\\n            f&quot;&amp;q={query}&quot; \\\\\\n            f&quot;&amp;query-fields={query_fields}&quot; \\\\\\n            f&quot;§ion={section}&quot; \\\\\\n            f&quot;&amp;tag={tag}&quot; \\\\\\n            f&quot;&amp;from-date={from_date}&quot; \\\\\\n            f&quot;&amp;show-fields=headline,byline,starRating,shortUrl&quot;\\n\\nr = requests.get(query_url)\\npprint(r.json())\\n</code></pre><p> The reason I first showed you <i>section</i> and <i>tag</i> search is that those can be used in the article search. Above you can see that we used <code class=\"inline\">section</code> and <code class=\"inline\">tag</code> parameters to narrow down our search, which values can be found using previously shown queries. Apart from these parameters, we also included the obvious <code class=\"inline\">q</code> parameter for our search query, but also starting date using <code class=\"inline\">from-date</code> as well as <code class=\"inline\">show-fields</code> parameter, which allows us to request extra fields related to the content - in this case those would be headline, byline, rating and shortened URL. There&#39;s bunch more of those with full list available <a href=\"https://open-platform.theguardian.com/documentation/search\">here</a>. </p><p> And as with all the previous ones, here is example response: </p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">\\n{&#39;response&#39;: {&#39;currentPage&#39;: 1, &#39;orderBy&#39;: &#39;relevance&#39;, &#39;pageSize&#39;: 10, &#39;pages&#39;: 1,\\n              &#39;results&#39;: [{&#39;apiUrl&#39;: &#39;https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2019/dec/19/weatherwatch-storms-hit-france-and-iceland-as-australia-overheats&#39;,\\n                           &#39;fields&#39;: {&#39;byline&#39;: &#39;Daniel Gardner (MetDesk)&#39;,\\n                                      &#39;headline&#39;: &#39;Weatherwatch: storms hit France and Iceland as Australia overheats&#39;,\\n                                      &#39;shortUrl&#39;: &#39;https://gu.com/p/dv4dq&#39;},\\n                           &#39;id&#39;: &#39;news/2019/dec/19/weatherwatch-storms-hit-france-and-iceland-as-australia-overheats&#39;,\\n                           &#39;pillarId&#39;: &#39;pillar/news&#39;,\\n                           &#39;sectionId&#39;: &#39;news&#39;,\\n                           &#39;type&#39;: &#39;article&#39;,\\n                           &#39;webPublicationDate&#39;: &#39;2019-12-19T11:33:52Z&#39;,\\n                           &#39;webTitle&#39;: &#39;Weatherwatch: storms hit France and &#39;\\n                                       &#39;Iceland as Australia overheats&#39;,\\n                           &#39;webUrl&#39;: &#39;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/19/weatherwatch-storms-hit-france-and-iceland-as-australia-overheats&#39;},\\n                          {&#39;apiUrl&#39;: &#39;https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2020/jan/31/weatherwatch-how-repeated-flooding-can-shift-levees&#39;,\\n                           &#39;fields&#39;: {&#39;byline&#39;: &#39;David Hambling&#39;,\\n                                      &#39;headline&#39;: &#39;Weatherwatch: how repeated &#39;\\n                                                  &#39;flooding can shift levees&#39;,\\n                                      &#39;shortUrl&#39;: &#39;https://gu.com/p/d755m&#39;},\\n                           &#39;id&#39;: &#39;news/2020/jan/31/weatherwatch-how-repeated-flooding-can-shift-levees&#39;,\\n                           &#39;pillarId&#39;: &#39;pillar/news&#39;,\\n                           &#39;sectionId&#39;: &#39;news&#39;,\\n                           &#39;type&#39;: &#39;article&#39;,\\n                           &#39;webPublicationDate&#39;: &#39;2020-01-31T21:30:00Z&#39;,\\n                           &#39;webTitle&#39;: &#39;Weatherwatch: how repeated flooding can shift levees&#39;,\\n                           &#39;webUrl&#39;: &#39;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/jan/31/weatherwatch-how-repeated-flooding-can-shift-levees&#39;}],\\n              &#39;startIndex&#39;: 1, &#39;status&#39;: &#39;ok&#39;, &#39;total&#39;: 7, &#39;userTier&#39;: &#39;developer&#39;}}\\n</code></pre><h2>HackerNews</h2><p> For more tech oriented source of news, one might turn to <i>HackerNews</i>, which also has its public REST API. It&#39;s documented on <a href=\"https://github.com/HackerNews/API\">https://github.com/HackerNews/API</a>. This API, as you will see, is in version <code class=\"inline\">v0</code> and is currently very bare-bones, meaning it doesn&#39;t really provide specific endpoints to - for example - query articles, comments or users. </p><p> But even though it&#39;s very basic it still provides all that&#39;s necessary to, for example, get top stories: </p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">\\nquery_type = &quot;top&quot;  # top/best/new, also ask/show/job\\nquery_url = f&quot;https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/{query_type}stories.json?print=pretty&quot;  # Top Stories\\nr = requests.get(query_url)\\nids = r.json()\\n\\ntop = ids[:10]\\nfor story in top:\\n    query_url = f&quot;https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/{story}.json?print=pretty&quot;\\n    r = requests.get(query_url)\\n    pprint(r.json())\\n</code></pre><p> The snippet above is not nearly as obvious as the previous ones, so let&#39;s look at it more closely. We first send request to API endpoint (<code class=\"inline\">v0/topstories</code>), which doesn&#39;t return top stories as you would expect, but really just their IDs. To get the actual stories we take these IDs (first 10 of them) and send requests to <code class=\"inline\">v0/item/&lt;ID&gt;</code> endpoint which returns data for each of these individual items, which in this case happens to be a story. </p><p> You surely noticed that the query URL was parametrized with <code class=\"inline\">query_type</code>. That&#39;s because, HackerNews API also has similar endpoints for all the top sections of the website, that being - ask, show, job or new. </p><p> One nice thing about this API is that it doesn&#39;t require authenticate, so you don&#39;t need to request API key and don&#39;t need to worry about rate limiting like with the other ones. </p><p> Running this code would land response that looks something like this: </p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">\\n{&#39;by&#39;: &#39;rkwz&#39;,\\n &#39;descendants&#39;: 217,\\n &#39;id&#39;: 24120311,\\n &#39;kids&#39;: [24122571,\\n          ...,\\n          24121481],\\n &#39;score&#39;: 412,\\n &#39;time&#39;: 1597154451,\\n &#39;title&#39;: &#39;Single Page Applications using Rust&#39;,\\n &#39;type&#39;: &#39;story&#39;,\\n &#39;url&#39;: &#39;http://www.sheshbabu.com/posts/rust-wasm-yew-single-page-application/&#39;}\\n{&#39;by&#39;: &#39;bmgoss&#39;,\\n &#39;descendants&#39;: 5,\\n &#39;id&#39;: 24123372,\\n &#39;kids&#39;: [24123579, 24124181, 24123545, 24123929],\\n &#39;score&#39;: 55,\\n &#39;time&#39;: 1597168165,\\n &#39;title&#39;: &#39;Classic Books for Tech Leads (or those aspiring to be)&#39;,\\n &#39;type&#39;: &#39;story&#39;,\\n &#39;url&#39;: &#39;https://sourcelevel.io/blog/3-classic-books-for-tech-leads-or-those-aspiring-to-be&#39;}\\n{&#39;by&#39;: &#39;adamnemecek&#39;,\\n &#39;descendants&#39;: 7,\\n &#39;id&#39;: 24123283,\\n &#39;kids&#39;: [24123803, 24123774, 24124106, 24123609],\\n &#39;score&#39;: 69,\\n &#39;time&#39;: 1597167845,\\n &#39;title&#39;: &#39;Bevy: Simple, data-driven, wgpu-based game engine in Rust&#39;,\\n &#39;type&#39;: &#39;story&#39;,\\n &#39;url&#39;: &#39;https://bevyengine.org&#39;}\\n</code></pre><p> If you found an interesting articles and wanted to dig a little deeper, then HackerNews API can help with that too. You can find comments of each submission by traversing <code class=\"inline\">kids</code> field of said story. Code that would do just that looks like so: </p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">\\nfirst = 24120311  # Top story\\nquery_url = f&quot;https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/{first}.json?print=pretty&quot;\\nr = requests.get(query_url)\\ncomment_ids = r.json()[&quot;kids&quot;]  # IDs of top level comments of first story\\n\\nfor i in comment_ids[:10]:  # Print first 10 comments of story\\n    query_url = f&quot;https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/{i}.json?print=pretty&quot;\\n    r = requests.get(query_url)\\n    pprint(r.json())\\n</code></pre><p> First, we look up story (<code class=\"inline\">item</code>) by ID like we did in previous example. We then iterate over its <code class=\"inline\">kids</code> and run same query with respective IDs retrieving items that in this case refer to story comments. We could also go through these recursively if we wanted to build whole tree/thread of comments of specific story. </p><p> As always, here is sample response: </p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">\\n{&#39;by&#39;: &#39;Naac&#39;,\\n &#39;id&#39;: 24123455,\\n &#39;kids&#39;: [24123485],\\n &#39;parent&#39;: 24120311,\\n &#39;text&#39;: &#39;So as I understand it Rust is compelling because it is a safer &#39;\\n         &#39;alternative to C++ ( and sometimes C but mainly a C++ replacement &#39;\\n         &#39;).&lt;p&gt;We wouldn&#39;t usually create a single page app in C++ right? &#39;\\n         &#39;So why would we want to do that in Rust ( other than, &quot;just &#39;\\n         &#39;because&quot; ).

There are however, sources of aggregate news data which can be used to get articles and news from newspapers like for example <i>Financial Times</i> and <i>Bloomberg</i> which only provide paid API services or like <i>CNN</i> doesn&#39;t expose any API at all. </p><p> One of these aggregators is called <a href=\"https://currentsapi.services/en\"><i>Currents API</i></a>. It aggregates data from thousands of sources, 18 languages and over 70 countries and it&#39;s also free. </p><p> It&#39;s similar to the APIs shown before. We again need to first get API key.

All of those are pretty self-explanatory, but for those first three I mentioned, you will need some extra information as their possible values aren&#39;t really obvious. These values come from API endpoints available <a href=\"https://currentsapi.services/api/docs/\">here</a> and in case of languages and regions are really just mappings of value to code (e.g. <code class=\"inline\">&quot;English&quot;: &quot;en&quot;</code>) and in case of categories just a list of possible values. It&#39;s omitted in the code above to make it a bit shorter, but I just copied these mappings into Python <code class=\"inline\">dict</code>s to avoid calling API every time. </p><p> Response to above request lands the following: </p><pre><code class=\"language-python\">\\n{&#39;news&#39;: [{&#39;author&#39;: &#39;Bloomberg News&#39;,\\n           &#39;category&#39;: [&#39;business&#39;],\\n           &#39;description&#39;: &#39;(Bloomberg) — Bitcoin is notoriously volatile, prone to sudden price surges and swift reversals &#39;\\n                          &#39;that can wipe out millions of dollars of value in a matter of minutes.

The ones shown in this article are the rare few with nice API and free access that you can use for your next project whether it&#39;s some data science, machine learning or simple news aggregator. If you don&#39;t mind paying some money for news API, you might also consider using <a href=\"https://developer.ft.com/portal\">Financial Times</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/support/api-library/\">Bloomberg</a>. Apart from APIs you can also try scraping HTML and parsing the content yourself with something like <a href=\"https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/\">BeautifulSoup</a>. If you happen to find any other good source of news data, please let me know, so that I can add it to this list. 🙂 </p><!--]--></div></div></article><div class=\"navbar\" data-v-a3042193><span class=\"footer-action\" data-v-a3042193><a href=\"/blog/30\" data-v-a3042193><i class=\"icon-left-open\" href=\"/blog/30\" data-v-a3042193></i><span class=\"footer-action-text\" data-v-a3042193>Previous</span><span class=\"footer-action-text-short\" data-v-a3042193>Prev.</span></a></span><span class=\"footer-action\" data-v-a3042193><a href=\"/blog/32\" data-v-a3042193><i class=\"icon-right-open\" href=\"/blog/32\" data-v-a3042193></i><span class=\"footer-action-text\" data-v-a3042193>Next</span><span class=\"footer-action-text-short\" data-v-a3042193>Next</span></a></span><span class=\"footer-action\" data-v-a3042193><i id=\"top_icon\" class=\"icon-up-open\" href=\"#\" data-v-a3042193></i><span class=\"footer-action-text\" data-v-a3042193>Top</span><span class=\"footer-action-text-short\" data-v-a3042193>Top</span></span><span class=\"footer-action\" data-v-a3042193><a href=\"/subscribe\" class=\"\" data-v-a3042193><i class=\"icon-rss\" data-v-a3042193></i><span class=\"footer-action-text\" data-v-a3042193>Subscribe</span><span class=\"footer-action-text-short\" data-v-a3042193>Sub</span></a></span><span class=\"footer-action\" data-v-a3042193><a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/martinheinz\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-a3042193><i class=\"icon-cup\" data-v-a3042193></i><i class=\"icon-money\" data-v-a3042193></i><span class=\"footer-action-text\" data-v-a3042193>Tip Jar</span><span class=\"footer-action-text-short\" data-v-a3042193>Tips</span></a></span></div></div><div class=\"mailing-list\"><h2><i class=\"icon-paper-plane\"></i> Subscribe:</h2><div><form id=\"sub-mail\" method=\"post\" novalidate=\"true\"><!----><p class=\"form-field\"><input id=\"email\" type=\"email\" value=\"\" placeholder=\"E-mail Address\"></p><p class=\"form-field\"><input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\"></p><div></div></form></div></div><footer id=\"footer\"><div class=\"footer-left\"> Copyright © 2023 Martin Heinz </div><div class=\"footer-right\"><nav><ul><!--[--><li><a href=\"/\">Home</a></li><li><a href=\"/contact\">Contact</a></li><li><a href=\"/subscribe\">Subscribe</a></li><li><a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/martinheinz\">Tip Jar</a></li><!--]--></ul></nav></div></footer></div></div></div><!--]--><div class=\"nuxt-progress\" style=\"display:none;width:0%;\" data-v-1c64d9bb></div></div></div><script>window.__NUXT__=(function(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l){e.id=c;e.created_at=a;e.updated_at=a;e.deleted_at=b;e.title=f;e.text=\"\\\\u003Cp\\\\u003E\\\\nWhether you are data scientist, programmer or AI specialist, you surely can put huge number of news articles to some good use.

Most large web scale companies use a combination of authentication and rate limiting to control access to their data to ensure that everyone using it abides.

    "Now that we have completed the \"hello world\" of working with the Yelp API, we are ready to really fly! The rest of the exercise will have a bit less direction since there are a variety of ways to retrieve the requested information but you should have all the component knowledge at this point to work with the API. Yelp being a fairly general platform actually has many more business than just restaurants, but by using the flexibility of the API we can ask it to only return the restaurants.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And before we can get any reviews on restaurants, we need to actually get the metadata on ALL of the restaurants in Chicago. Notice above that while Yelp told us that there are ~240, the response contained fewer actual `Business` objects. This is due to pagination and is a safeguard against returning __TOO__ much data in a single request (what would happen if there were 100,000 restaurants?) and can be used in conjuction with _rate limiting_ as well as a way to throttle and protect access to Yelp data.\n",
    "\n",
    "> As a thought exercise, consider: If an API has 1,000,000 records, but only returns 10 records per page and limits you to 5 requests per second... how long will it take to acquire ALL of the records contained in the API?\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the ways that APIs are an improvement over plain web scraping is the ability to make __parameterized__ requests. Just like the Python functions you have been writing have arguments (or parameters) that allow you to customize its behavior/actions (an output) without having to rewrite the function entirely, we can parameterize the queries we make to the Yelp API to filter the results it returns."

For data science and _programatic_ analysis this raw form is quite ideal, but for an end user requesting information from a _graphical interface_ (like a web browser) this is very far from ideal since it takes some cognitive overhead to interpret the raw information.
